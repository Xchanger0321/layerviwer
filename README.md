# SuperSplat Viewer

This is the official viewer for https://superspl.at and the SuperSplat Editor HTML export.

This webapp compiles to simple, self-contained, static website.

The app supports a few useful URL parameters (though please note these are subject to change):
- `&settings=url` - specify the URL of the `settings.json` file (default is `./settings.json`)
- `&content=url` - specify the URL of the `scene.compressed.ply` file (default is `./scene.compressed.ply`)

As well as the following:
- `&noui` - hide UI
- `&noanim` - start with animation paused
- `&poster=url` - show an image while loading the scene content
- `&ministats` - show the runtime CPU (and on desktop, GPU) performance graphs
- `&skybox=url` - specify an equirectangular skybox image for the skybox
